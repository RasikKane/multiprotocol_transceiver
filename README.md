# multiprotocol_transceiver

* Multiprotocol Transmitter-Receiver plays important role in building a network of systems supporting different protocols..

## Block diagram of proposed system

Information source can be analog such as electrical signal from microphone or digital such as binary data stream from computer. The transmitter would convert analog information into digital format. The protocol would be selected based upon user's selection. Information will be transmitted over selected protocol. Receiver will receive the information over particular protocol. Digitized information will then be converted back into analog format. Keypad will be used at transmitter end to select the protocol. User interface is provided via LCD showing the protocol being used.

## System Features
1. Two systems with different protocols can communicate without hardware and/or software changes.
2. Multicasting and/or broadcasting of information over multiple protocols is possible.
3. Protocol selection facility provided to the user.
4. System can access information easily from variety of sources (both analog and digital).
5. ARM family provides high performance ensuring communication compatibility with almost all existing embedded systems.
6. All commonly used protocols are supported. â€“ UART, SPI, I2C
7. User friendly system with small size, low weight.
8. Easy provision of hardware plug-ins for each protocol.
9. Optimal user interfacing viz. LCD, Keyboard etc.
10. Low Power Consumption achieved by using LPC 2148.
11. Two possible modes: - Battery operated and AC Mains driven.
